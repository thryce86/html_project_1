        <p>Ode to Bacon
            Oh, plate of bacon, how you tempt me so
            With your sizzle and your crunch I do crave
            A gift from Gods wrapped in a tasty bow
            There are no leftovers to even save
            
            Why can't I feel myself grow full from you?
            There are no others that can be as true
            Your fame is unmatched by any before and it's easy to see with such allure
            
            With every new bite, the tears grow stronger
            This small plate won't last for that much longer
            As the bacon leaves, I fear what's to come
            The plate is bare, with not even a crumb
            
            Oh, plate of bacon, I still need you so
            With hope, I pray for more bacon to show</p>
